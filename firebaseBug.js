The Firebase SDK may throw an error if it cannot establish a connection to the Firebase servers, due to network issues or server outages.  This is especially problematic if your app doesn't have robust error handling.  Additionally,  in rare cases, asynchronous operations within Firebase may not resolve correctly, leading to race conditions or unexpected behavior. For example, attempting to access data from a database before the data has fully loaded can lead to null pointer exceptions or incorrect data being used. The lack of clear error messages in such cases can make debugging difficult.
